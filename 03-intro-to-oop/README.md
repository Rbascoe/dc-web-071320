* Define `object` in programming domain
* Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
* Explain the difference between a class and an instance
* Pass arguments to `new` by defining an initialize method in class
* Create instance methods
* Call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`
* Define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros
* Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables

instance variables (@): Available everywhere within the instance of that class
